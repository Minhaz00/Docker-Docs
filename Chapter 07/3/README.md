# Reviewing filesystem changes

In this lab, we will learn how to review filesystem changes made inside a Docker container. Docker provides a command to list all changes to the filesystem, including added, changed, or deleted files and directories.

The objective of this lab is to create containers, make various modifications to their filesystems, and use the `docker container diff` command to review those changes. We will also learn how to clean up our workspace by removing the containers created during the lab.

## Task

1. Create a container and `add` a new file and review changes
2. Create another container and `delete` an existing file and review changes
3. Create yet another container and `change` an existing file and review changes
4. Clean up our workspace

## Steps

Follow these steps to complete the task:

1. **Create a container and add a new file:**

    ![alt text](./images/image.png)

    **Command**:
    ```sh
    docker container run --name tweak-a busybox:latest touch /HelloWorld
    ```

    This command runs a new container named `tweak-a` from the `busybox:latest` image and creates an empty file named `/HelloWorld` inside the container.

2. **Review the filesystem changes:**
    ```sh
    docker container diff tweak-a
    ```

    This command lists all the changes made to the `filesystem` of the `tweak-a` container. You should see:

    **Expected Output:**
    ```
    A /HelloWorld
    ```

    This indicates that the file /HelloWorld was added.


3. **Create another container and delete an existing file:**

    ![alt text](./images/image-1.png)

    **Command:**
    ```sh
    docker container run --name tweak-d busybox:latest rm /bin/vi
    ```

    This command runs a new container named `tweak-d` from the `busybox:latest` image and deletes the file `/bin/vi`.

4. **Review the filesystem changes:**
    ```sh
    docker container diff tweak-d
    ```

    This command lists all the changes made to the `filesystem` of the `tweak-d` container. You should see:

    **Expected Output:**
    ```
    C /bin
    D /bin/vi
    ```

    This indicates that the directory `/bin` was changed and the file `/bin/vi` was deleted.



5. **Create yet another container and change an existing file:**

    ![alt text](./images/image-2.png)

    **Command:**
    ```sh
    docker container run --name tweak-c busybox:latest touch /bin/vi
    ```

    This command runs a new container named `tweak-c` from the `busybox:latest` image and updates the modification time of the file `/bin/vi`.

6. **Review the filesystem changes:**
    ```sh
    docker container diff tweak-c
    ```

    This command lists all the changes made to the `filesystem` of the `tweak-c` container. You should see:

    **Expected Output:**
    ```
    C /bin
    C /bin/busybox
    ```

    This indicates that the directories /bin and /bin/busybox were changed.

7. **Clean up our workspace by removing the containers:**
    ```sh
    docker container rm -vf tweak-a
    docker container rm -vf tweak-d
    docker container rm -vf tweak-c
    ```

    These commands forcefully remove the `tweak-a`,` tweak-d`, and `tweak-c` containers, cleaning up our workspace.

## Explanation of `docker container diff` Output

- Lines that start with an `A` indicate files that were **added**.
- Lines that start with a `C` indicate files that were **changed**.
- Lines that start with a `D` indicate files that were **deleted**.

By following these steps, you'll be able to track and understand filesystem changes within Docker containers. This is particularly useful for debugging and for ensuring that your containerized applications behave as expected.

## Commands Summary

1. **Create a container and add a new file:**
    ```sh
    docker container run --name tweak-a busybox:latest touch /HelloWorld
    ```

2. **Review the filesystem changes:**
    ```sh
    docker container diff tweak-a
    ```

3. **Create another container and delete an existing file:**
    ```sh
    docker container run --name tweak-d busybox:latest rm /bin/vi
    ```

4. **Review the filesystem changes:**
    ```sh
    docker container diff tweak-d
    ```

5. **Create yet another container and change an existing file:**
    ```sh
    docker container run --name tweak-c busybox:latest touch /bin/vi
    ```

6. **Review the filesystem changes:**
    ```sh
    docker container diff tweak-c
    ```

7. **Clean up your workspace:**
    ```sh
    docker container rm -vf tweak-a
    docker container rm -vf tweak-d
    docker container rm -vf tweak-c
    ```
